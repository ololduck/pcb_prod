# PCB Production

This repository is a set of all the documents produced while creating the PCB print system i made for my personal use.

it basically has 3 steps:

1. UV exposure
2. UV-sensitive layer etching
3. Copper etching

Most of the schematics are made with [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org). It is a nice, user-friendly piece of software, enabling me to go from my breadboard to the actual *in-situ* system.

## UV exposure

I made a LED-based exposure unit, designed to be controlled from a front panel, with fancy switches with labels on it. And a 16x2 character LCD screen, too.

The board UV_timer.fzz is for use with [my minimal ATMega328 board](https://github.com/paulollivier/base_arduino_board), but remains usable with any other system.

## UV-sensitive layer etching

Here i will describe the recipe i use.

## Copper etching

Here too.

## TODO's

* Make some actual doc

    * document the construction of the uv exposer
    * document the process
    * document the etching recipes

* Write the ATMega328 software
